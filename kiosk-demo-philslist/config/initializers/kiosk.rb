# Kiosk-demo configuration — philslist, a NON-COMMERCE classifieds board.
#
# The whole point of this demo: the same per-verb wire the commerce demos use
# for money carries a services/data surface with NO payment at all. There is NO
# `payment_provider` here, so `capabilities` computes to schema/queries/actions and
# DROPS `pay` — `/.well-known/kiosk.json`, `agents.json` and
# `agents.txt` all advertise no payments. That absence is the not-only-commerce
# proof (`demo:schema` asserts it).

# Env posture (ephemeral dev signing key, PoW secret, issuer, test flags) lives
# in config/environments/{development,test,production}.rb (K-650); this file
# reads the resolved values from Rails.configuration.x.kiosk.*.

# Registration PoW gate — ALWAYS ON. With no payment gate, the registration PoW
# toll is the defense of a FREE board against spam-listing bots — same feature the
# commerce demos price fresh-identity minting with, new meaning. Register is now
# uniformly tolled on every demo (no per-demo env flag to remember): it activates
# on code-deploy and can't be forgotten. Params follow KIOSK_POW_DIFFICULTY
# (app/services/pow_difficulty.rb): low (default) → n=96 k=5 sub-second; high → n=168 k=7
# (~1.3 GiB per proof, and ~10s on the reference numpy solver as measured on one
# M-series laptop core). Unset = low, so the walkthrough/isolation/binding flows and CI
# stay fast; a deployer can set high to feel the toll. The prerequisites below MUST
# run unconditionally, else RegistrationPow.gate raises ConfigurationError at register.

  # ── NO payment_provider ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

  # payments block. philslist is a classifieds board — it takes no money.

  # ── NO c.agent_idp ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # Deliberate, and the point of the line's absence (T-104). An assistant
  # authenticates with the kiosk-pop JWT this very engine minted at
  # `/kiosk/auth/register`, `/auth/login` or the binding ceremony — and the
  # engine already ships the adapter that verifies its own tokens:
  # `IdentityResolution.agent_idp` falls back to
  # `Kiosk::Server::AgentIdentityProviders::DefaultAgentIdp` when nothing is
  # configured. This demo used to override it with a hand-copied composite that
  # re-implemented the JWT half (more loosely — it never checked `iss`) in
  # order to bolt on a dev-only parser turning a self-asserted
  # `agent:u-…:a-…:r-…` string into an identity at any role. Both are gone.
  # SET THIS only to front an EXTERNAL agent-identity issuer (Entra Agent ID,
  # Okta, an ID-JAG-style broker) by subclassing
  # `Kiosk::AgentIdentityProviders::Base` — whose one hard constraint is that
  # the `agent_id` you return must be a UUID (K-830).
  # The provider's own web-session channel (Devise/Warden): authenticates the
  # approving human on the account-binding surfaces — the device verify page,
  # link-code mint, unlink, and the manage-assistants page. Walked by
  # `rake demo:binding`.

  # ── One process today. Before this origin ever runs two, read this ───────
  # `pow_spent_store` is left at its IN-PROCESS default here, and that is
  # correct only because each demo origin runs a SINGLE process. Two Puma
  # workers, two dynos or two pods — or a rolling deploy where the old and the
  # new process overlap for a minute — each keep their OWN spent-id set, so
  # one proof is accepted once PER PROCESS and the toll above is silently
  # discounted by however many processes are running.
  #
  # WHY THIS IS WRITTEN DOWN RATHER THAN DETECTED: a replayed proof is not an
  # error. It verifies, it is accepted, the request succeeds — no exception,
  # no metric, no log line, no failed request, nothing in any dashboard. An
  # operator who scales from one worker to two gets NO signal at all that
  # their origin stopped conforming (kiosk.tech protocol.md §15.2 and the
  # §16.1 operator profile). So the remedy is stated, not inferred:
  #   c.pow_spent_store = Kiosk::Server::PowSpentStores::ActiveRecord.new
  # plus the one table it needs — see the kiosk-server README, "Multi-process
  # deployments". kiosk-server also logs a warning at boot in production when
  # this default is in use with PoW on (K-752), but a warning nobody reads is
  # not the mitigation; this comment and the README are.
